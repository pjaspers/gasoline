# Gasoline makes Campfire better

I'm an avid [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com) user and [Propane](http://propaneapp.com) is still my go to app for talking to it. At least on OSX, on iOS I'm using <plug>[Butane](http://getbutane.com)</plug>.

Since Propane 1.1.2 they've added a way to add some javascript, to augment the experience even more. Like adding avatars:

The only downside to that approach was managing the file. So that's where Gasoline comes in. It's a gem that installs the command line utility `gasoline` which can download gists and append them to the patch file.

## Installation

`gem install gasoline`

## Usage

`gasoline ignite` will download the default drops and install them to the patch file.
